We developed **PEA-m5C**, an accurate transcriptome-wide m5C modification predictor under machine learning framework with random forest algorithm. PEA-m5C was trained with features from the flanking sequences of m5C modifications. In addition, we also deposited all the candidate m5C modification sites in the [Ara-m5C database](http://bioinfo.nwafu.edu.cn/software/Ara-m5C.html) for follow-up functional mechanism researches. Finally, in order to maximize the usage of PEA-m5C, we implement it into a cross-platform, user-friendly and interactive interface and an R package named PEA-m5C based R statistical language and JAVA programming language, which may advance functional researches of m5C.
