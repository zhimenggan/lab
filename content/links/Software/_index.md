Recommended skills in the lab:
## **Software & Language & Environment**

*   [R](https://www.r-project.org/): R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS.
*   [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/): RStudio is an active member of the R community.
*   [Python](https://www.python.org/): Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively.
*   [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone): CUDA® is a parallel computing platform and programming model developed by NVIDIA for general computing on graphical processing units (GPUs). With CUDA, developers are able to dramatically speed up computing applications by harnessing the power of GPUs.
*   [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/): Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R. 
*   [Java](http://www.java.com): Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented,\[15\] and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. 
*   [Perl](http://www.perl.org/): Perl is a family of high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming languages. The languages in this family include Perl 5 and Perl 6.
*   [Matlab](https://cn.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html): MATLAB (matrix laboratory) is a multi-paradigm numerical computing environment. A proprietary programming language developed by MathWorks, MATLAB allows matrix manipulations, plotting of functions and data, implementation of algorithms, creation of user interfaces, and interfacing with programs written in other languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, Fortran, and Python.
