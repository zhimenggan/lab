Chuang Ma is a professor of Bioinformatics in College of Life Sciences, Northwest A&F University. His research interests include Artificial Intelligence: Large-scale integration and mining of 'omics' data with machine learning technologies; Abiotic Stress: Bioinformatics and systems biology approaches to understand molecular mechanisms by which plants respond to and mount resistance to environmental stresses; Plant Breeding: Bioinformatics and systems biology approaches to map genotyping to phenotyping for genomic selection (GS)-assisted plant breeding.

<!--
He leads a group of innovative researchers who conduct research on bioinformatics and systems biology in important plants, which are closely related to agricultural production.
