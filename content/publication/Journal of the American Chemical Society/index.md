abstract: "5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) arises from the oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) by Fe2+ and 2
-oxoglutarate-dependent 10â€“11 translocation (TET) family proteins. Substantial levels of 5hmC accumulate in many mammalian tissues, especially in neurons and embryonic stem cells, suggesting a potential active role for 5hmC in epigenetic regulation beyond being simply an intermediate of active DNA demethylation. 5mC and 5hmC undergo dynamic changes during embryogenesis, neurogenesis, hematopoietic development, and oncogenesis. While methods have been developed to map 5hmC, more efficient approaches to detect 5hmC at base resolution are still"
